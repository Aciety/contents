## Aciety Cooperation Agreement Annex No. 3

1. ### Introduction
    This Annex applies to all Users, who have received above zero value Pledge
    Allowance figure from Aciety in their Aciety Cooperation Agreements and who
    have a Confirmed Pledge.
    User (Pledger) agrees to accept defined amount of payments in TAP coupon (https://aciety.com/tap) from Aciety, distributors and other stakeholders for their Pledged IP.

    #### Definitions:
      1. **TAP** – Coupon of Aciety Platform, 1 unit of which represents
         1/10,000,000 of Total Pledged Value in Aciety.
      1. **XTAP** - exchange rate of TAP to EUR when buying Pledged IP for TAP:
         1 TAP = Total Pledged Value / 10,000,000.
      1. **Pledged IP** - (a) licensed Intellectual Property; (b) subscription-based cloud software; (c) standardized services listed in Aciety Marketplace by the Pledger that can be paid in TAP. 
      1. **Pledge** - How much stakeholders can buy of Pledged IP for TAP coupon at XTAP rate before the Pledge expires, in the event Pledger would like to terminate the Pledge. 
      1. **Pledger** – User, which has received above zero Pledge Allowance
         figure from Aciety and has signed above zero Pledge value in any way
         specified in this Annex.
      1. **Pledge Allowance** – Maximum Pledge value as determined by Aciety
         for a particular User.
      1. **Confirmed Pledge** – Pledge value signed by Pledger in their Aciety
         Cooperation Agreement, or later added via Aciety System, or sent via email
         to pledges@aciety.com and confirmed by Aciety with corresponding Pledge
         Reward.
      1. **Total Pledged Value** - Sum value in EUR of all Pledges from
         Confirmed Pledges + 1 million EUR.
      1. **Pledge Reward** - Reward in  TAP coupons for Pledger for their
         Confirmed Pledge = 1.25% * Pledge / XTAP.
      1. **Total Pledge Rewards** – Sum of TAP coupons in all Pledge Rewards.
      1. **Distributed TAP** – TAP distributed by Aciety to stakeholders
         according to conditions of Aciety Coupon Model.
      1. **Circulation** – Distributed TAP, not held in Aciety wallets, or held
         in Aciety wallets on behalf of Users.

    #### Because:
      1. Aciety has created and is in control of Aciety Marketplace, that is
         used to buy, sell and exchange software;
      1. Aciety pre-screens software producers to find ones that have valuable
         and marketable products;
      1. Aciety helps clients to find the most suitable software development
         partners and software products for their particular (usually high scale,
         long-term) need;
      1. Aciety has launched a coupon, which is meant to encourage code re-use,
         marketing and reward system for TAP stakeholders;
      1. Aciety is releasing 10 million TAP coupons, value of which is based on XTAP rate (https://aciety.com/tap);
      1. Pledging is designed to ensure TAP buys at least as much software
         (or more) compared to the date it was distributed, ensuring favorable use by distributors, Pledgers and other stakeholders;  
      1. Coupons are distributed in a unique model (Aciety Coupon Model),
         creating unparalleled affiliate opportunities:
        1. First TAP is backed by software, only then it reaches the market;
        1. When paying for Pledged IP, TAP value is equal to XTAP rate and as with new Pledgers this value grows, it provides surplus commission to distributors, while maintaining low fees to Pledgers;
      1. TAP effectively becomes accumulating discount coupon in a period while Aciety is on-boarding new Pledgers and universal software coupon - when on-boarding will reach maturity (at roughly 10,000 products);
         

1. ### General Conditions
    1. **Pledged Software** – Pledger confirms: a) they have full rights to
       sell or otherwise distribute the software they listed on Aciety
       Marketplace;
       b) descriptions of such software are accurate and not misleading;
       c) they took necessary steps and will honor any purchase over 100 TAP for
       their Pledged IP at equal terms as their traditional clients with up to
       one work day delay; d) they will provide Aciety an up to date pricing of
       their Pledged IP and that it will be used when calculating how much TAP
       at XTAP rate should be used to pay for the Pledged IP; e) if pricing in
       EUR or any other currency in Pledger’s official website (or websites) is
       less than stated in Aciety Marketplace, Aciety and/or any TAP holder can
       request such pricing to be used when using TAP for purchase; f) they will
       provide support to buyers of their Pledged IP as stated by the Pledger in
       Pledged IP licenses and/or their product page descriptions.  
    1. **Pledged Value** – Pledger confirms: a) they understand Pledge value defines how much Aciety, distributors and stakeholders can buy their product for TAP coupon before their Pledge expires, in the event Pledger would like to terminate the Pledge (if Pledger returns their Pledge Reward in full to Aciety, Pledge Minimum value would be used instead of Pledge value); b) if they request to terminate the Pledge, they will receive 75% on remaining sales proceeds, which would be distributed to the Pledger once Total Pledged Value grows higher than it is at the date the Pledger requested to terminate their Pledge.
    1. **Pledge Allowance** – Pledge Allowance is no more than (lowest of the following
       values, but not less than 25,000 EUR): a) specified by Aciety on
       individual case basis; b) 10% (ten per-cent) of Total Pledged Value;
    1. **TAP Distribution** -  Aciety has issued and distributes 10 million TAP coupons. TAP may be released outside Aciety (in Aciety System and/or over blockchain for better authentication) and Aciety will exchange the older versions of TAP to the newer ones to retain a total of up to 10 million units of TAP in Circulation. Pledger confirms they will accept TAP at XTAP rate for as long as Aciety distributes TAP as per Aciety Coupon Model. If Pledger fulfills all conditions within this Agreement, they will receive Pledge Reward. If Pledger does not fulfill any of the conditions in this Agreement, they may receive a penalty up to the size of their Pledge Reward, paid in TAP to Aciety.
    1. **Other Conditions** – Aciety has made 1 million EUR pledge as a first
       pledger and will accept TAP for its products placed in Aciety Marketplace
       for as long as there will be any TAP in Circulation. Aciety maintains
       database of all Pledges and gives access to a list of products that could
       be bought for TAP to any TAP holder, owning over 1000 TAP if requested,
       with limitations as set by Pledgers.
    1. **Untimely Termination** – In case Pledger cannot fulfill their Pledge
       anymore for any reason on their own, they agree to pass access to Pledged
       IP to Aciety with the right to sell such Pledged IP for the amount equal to
       Pledge with all sales proceedings going in equal splits to Supplier Pool
       and Client Pool.

1. ### Aciety Coupon Model

    Aciety has designed a coupon distribution model, which ensures that TAP
    is distributed primarily to its stakeholders and in a way
    to maximize growth of Aciety Marketplace and TAP adoption. There is a
    limited number of TAP (ten million coupons), distributed between five
    coupon pools, each with certain distribution conditions:

    1. **Supplier Pool** – 2 million (20%) TAP coupons rewarded to Pledgers as
       Pledge Reward, per its reward formula.  
    1. **Partner Pool** – 2 million (20%) TAP coupons rewarded to partners, who
       should provide substantial growth in Aciety Marketplace clientele, or
       Pledgers. Limitation – Aciety has a right to reward partners in total no
       more than 2 * Total Pledge Rewards + 100,000 TAP in any given point of time.
    1. **Infrastructure Pool** – 2 million (20%) TAP coupons rewarded to
       infrastructure producers, who contribute legal, technological, or business
       support to expansion of Aciety Marketplace and/or use cases for TAP.
       Limitation – Aciety has a right to reward infrastructure producers in total
       no more than 2 * Total Pledge Rewards + 100,000 TAP in any given point of
       time.
    1. **Client Pool** – 2 million (20%) TAP coupons sold as software coupons to
       Aciety clients (with intention to favor software service companies, which
       could use TAP to buy products for their clientele). Limitation – Aciety has
       a right to sell clients in total no more than
       2 * Total Pledge Rewards + 100,000 TAP in any given point of time.
    1. **Team Pool** -  2 million (20%) TAP coupons split between shareholders
       and employees of Aciety. Limitations: a) Locked for 1 year from the moment
       Total Pledged Value will surpass 10 million EUR; b) Unlocked afterwards
       proportionally based on formula: 0.25 * (sum of TAP distributed from Supplier, Partner, Infrastructure and Client Pools).
